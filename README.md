# Hey!
This is the public code for my [Portfolio website](https://portfolio.petstergaming.com) using NextJS

As I learn more about react, other frameworks and website development and design I wanted to have this websites code be public for my own personal growth and maybe to help others

This project was built using [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
